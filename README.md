# Personal Finance Cheatsheet

## Keeping financial records

- Get a box that you can use to hold file folders for quick access to files.
- Most records should be kept in a file folder for the corresponding year, e.g. 2017, 2016, 2015. Older years can be grouped together and put into a binder, e.g. 2010-2014.
- File by year. Write the date in colored ink at the top of each sheet that you file.
- Keep tax records in their own folders, e.g. 2017 Taxes, 2016 Taxes.
- Keep tax records for 7 years.
- Stuff that isn't time dependent, such as social security card, car title, house records, insurance policies, etc. should be kept in their own file folders or envelopes.
- Remember that most records don't need to be kept permanently. When you start running out of room, you can throw older documents out or place them into a binder that goes in a box somewhere.
