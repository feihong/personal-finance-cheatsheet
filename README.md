# Personal Finance Cheatsheet

## Paying bills

- Make a spreadsheet of all your billed accounts (rent, electric, gas, internet, credit card, etc).
- Set up auto-pay for bills using your credit card (so you can earn points).
- For bills that can't be paid using a credit card, use the auto-pay feature of your checking account (make sure to set an end date so you don't keep paying the landlord after your lease is expired).

## Keeping financial records

- Get a box that you can use to hold file folders for quick access to files.
- Most records should be kept in a file folder for the corresponding year, e.g. 2017, 2016, 2015. Older years can be grouped together and put into a binder, e.g. 2010-2014.
- File by year. Write the date in colored ink at the top of each sheet that you file.
- Keep tax records in their own folders, e.g. 2017 Taxes, 2016 Taxes.
- Keep tax records for 7 years.
- Stuff that isn't time dependent, such as social security card, car title, house records, insurance policies, etc. should be kept in their own file folders or envelopes.
- Remember that most records don't need to be kept permanently. When you start running out of room, you can throw older documents out or place them into a binder that goes in a box somewhere.

## Retirement savings

- Put money in Roth 401k, up to employer's match.
- Put money into Health Savings Account.
- Put money into Roth IRA (use Vanguard).
- If IRA is maxed out, then put more money into 401k.
- If you have any money left, open non-retirement investment account and add money to it.
- You should automate the process of paying into your retirement accounts.
- Keep a spreadsheet of the annual contribution limits for retirement accounts and how much you contribute every month. This way you can prevent yourself from accidentally going over them.
- Schedule an annual review of your retirement contributions to make sure you're maxing them out.

## Security

- Use a password manager to store your online account credentials.
- Use a different password for each account. 
- Always use a strong password.
- If possible, link account authentication to your cell phone. For example I can't log in to my Vanguard account unless I enter a security code that I receive via text message.
